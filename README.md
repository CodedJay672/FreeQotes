# introduction
FreeQuotes is an online quotes generation application which allows users to search for different quotes from different authors and times. The application consumes a free api which provides all the required endpoints which we will consume in this project. The Daily Quotes are generated for users everyday at midnight and they can be of different categories fromo inspirational to technical like coding and Linux operating system quotes.

## Inspiration
The inspiration behind this project is the need for new challenges. Since after graduation from the ALX sofotware engineering program, i have since had little or no motivation to code that much. Since i came across the api. i decided to implement it as a means to keep sharpening my skill and ideas on frontend development.

## Technologies
This project will implement HTML for structure, CSS for styling and Javascript for interactivity. Other libraries like ReactJs and its libraries will also be used to make development faster. Webpack and npm will be used for bundling the files. Other packages will be decumented as they occur in the program.

##Notice
This documentation is subject to review as writing a good readme file is also something i have to work on so that my designs can look more professional. Thanks
